# CalendarProblem

Given the calendar booked time of two people find all available time they can meet.
Restrictions:
- each calendar will have limits, min and max range (ex: one maybe from 8:00 until 20:00,
maybe one starting from 10:00 until 18:00)
- the range of all available (free) time they can meet will have to fit into the meeting
required time (a variable input set to minutes)
- you must find all free time between the 2 calendars that is bigger or equal to the given
meeting minutes time

Sample input:
booked calendar1: [['9:00','10:30'], ['12:00','13:00'], ['16:00','18:00]]
calendar1 range limits: ['9:00','20:00']
booked calendar2: [['10:00','11:30'], ['12:30','14:30'],['14:30','15:00], ['16:00','17:00']]
calendar2 range limits: ['10:00','18:30']
Meeting Time Minutes: 30

Sample output:
[['11:30','12:00'], ['15:00','16:00'], ['18:00':'18:30']]
